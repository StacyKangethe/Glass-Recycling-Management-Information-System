# Glass-Recycling-Management-Information-System
A school midterm project, whose objective was to identify a problem and develop a solution.
Problem: The low rate of glass recycling in Kenya considering glass is an infinitely recyclable material.
Problem statement: The lack of a digital system to help properly dispose of glass waste for recycling.
The main reason for the low glass recycling rate is contamination. There is no established system to separate glass waste from other wastes.
Solution: Develop a web-based platform that will bring together all stakeholders in the glass eco-system to one platform where they can directly 
communicate and collaborate to increase the rate of glass recycling.
Caution: This project is for demonstration purposes only. No company information should be taken as real information.

Technologies Used: React, Material UI, NodeJS, JWT.
